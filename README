NAME

Dresden - A module for mostly educational purposes,
          although with useful functionality.

ABOUT

  This project is an educational collecting tank for any functions
  and/or experiments we (the Dresden Perl Mongers) need a place for.

  Version 0.01, for instance, was an empty project, simply
  demonstrating the construction of a CPAN distribution.

  Sometimes a useful module starts his live here as happened with
  TWikiClient.

  See the modules

    Acme::PM::Dresden::TWikiClient     (now WWW::TWikiClient),
    Acme::PM::Dresden::VQWikiClient
    Acme::PM::Dresden::Convert::VQWiki2TWiki

  for first useful stuff.


SYNOPSIS

 use Acme::PM::Dresden;
