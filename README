NAME

Dresden - A module for mostly educational purposes,
          although with useful functionality.

ABOUT

  This project is an educational collecting tank for any functions
  and/or experiments we (the Dresden Perl Mongers) need a place for.

  Version 0.01, for instance, was an empty project, simply
  demonstrating the construction of a CPAN distribution.

  There are future plans, to make it a useful module, e.g., it will
  provide information about Dresden Perl Mongers, either in a static
  or dynamic network fashion based on info on our homepage.

  See the modules
    Acme::PM::Dresden::TWikiClient,
    Acme::PM::Dresden::VQWikiClient
    Acme::PM::Dresden::Convert::VQWiki2TWiki
  for first useful stuff.

SYNOPSIS

 use Acme::PM::Dresden;
